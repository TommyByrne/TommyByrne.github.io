Anyone who has ever programmed has felt that pounding headache you get when you feel like your day or even week has been nothing but banging your head against a brick wall.  Many of us get so tied up with where we want to be that we often forget where we are now.  We get flustered, discouraged, doubtful, angry and for many this becomes the end of the journey. Don’t fool yourself quitting is only good when you are talking about cigarettes.  Remember why you started your journey and don’t let a few headaches stop you.</p>

<p>The old saying goes,  “If it were easy, it wouldn’t be worth doing.”  This quote can be hard to swallow while you are experiencing one of these headaches, but just remember it’s a lot less rewarding when you’re good at something that everyone else is good at.  A simple question can prove this.  When is the last time you brushed your teeth and felt success? I’d imagine never, and this may be an extreme example but the point is success and satisfaction come with hard work. The headaches are just free gifts you get along the way.</p>

<p>By now you may be thinking tell me something I didn’t know. The truth is I don’t have anything to tell you that hasn’t been said 1000 times before. However sometimes a fresh reminder that you are not alone in what you are experiencing is all you need to get you past one of these walls.  If that is you know that <strong>MY HEAD HURTS!</strong>  I have a headache because my blinded vision of where I want to be and where I’m at, started to cloud my mind.  Here are a few things that I wish I could have thought about before I spent hours banging my head against the wall today.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Don’t let your mind work against you</strong>  Sometimes when your plan doesn’t work out just right you often feel like you are failing or missing out.  Use the moment and what you are dealt to learn.  If you can take every situation you go into is as a learning opportunity, you stop putting unnecessary stress on yourself and actually start growing.</li>
  <li><strong>Remember your tools</strong> It’s almost certain that at some point while learning something new you will fail.  Don’t let that get you so worked up, you forget your resources.  While programing it’s easy to see an <code>error</code> and throw your hands up.  Use your tools.  debuggers, console, log files, Stackoverflow, and documentation are all often forgotten about when that headache sets in.</li>
  <li><strong>Slow down</strong>  I wish I could get back all the hours I lost overlooking the mistake that was hitting me right in the face because I was rushing.  If you start getting that feeling you're banging your head against the wall take a step back and breathe instead of staying in that clouded mindset.</li>
  <li><strong>Believe in yourself</strong>  Sometimes being your biggest critic can hurt you. Believing in yourself can go a long way.  This can help get your mind in a better place when things do go wrong.  Your a lot less likely to quit when you believe rather than doubt.</li>
</ol>

<p>Like I said before nothing new, but I hope reading these few tips can help you next time you hit a wall in your journey. I can promise that your head will never get you through the wall If you simply keep banging. If you can stop and think there usually is a door you can go though if you spend a little time looking.</p>
