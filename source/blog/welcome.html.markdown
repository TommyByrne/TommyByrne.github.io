Today marks the beginning of a new journey.  At first glance it may seem like such an insignificant step but this post is the first step into the vast wilderness of a land vaguely called "Web Development".  Now I'll be the first to tell you that this land is vast and if entering it unprepared one can find themselves lost and in desperate need for rescue right from the start.  Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Git, Angular, Backbone, RSpec, React, C#, C++, C, Python, SQL, Perl, .NET, and Swift are just a few of the endless buzz words that you will run across on your first few step into your journey.  You find yourself at a cross roads before you even begin and are stuck trying to decide often without any real clue on if the choice you are about to make is the right one.  With that initial decision the struggles can start to snowball out of control before you even know what has happened.

The real danger comes when everyone starting out on this journey is handed a double edged sword. If not handled properly this sword can easily do more damage than good. The sword in our case being "the INTERNET"; it is giant and powerful but if not handled with precision and elegance can be the one thing that ends your journey rather than excels it.

This sword creates paths that are endless, complex, and often tangled with intersection that can lead you to a long dark empty dead end.  However on the other hand if handled properly it can lead you down successful path with the vast knowledge and resources it provides.

I'm not here to tell you what the right path is because I don't think there is a so called "right path".  What I am here to tell you is no matter what path you decide to go down be ready for the bumps and detours along the way.  Its importance to stay focused and try to stay on one path at a time.  You can do this by setting goals and not allowing yourself to fall victim to your own excitement of all the new buzz words that will be pulling you in all different directions.  If the passion is present there is always going to be new and exciting opportunities that will try and derail your journey.

The best advice I can give you is be disciplined at the task at hand.  You need to build a solid foundation before you can start adding new floors to any structure.  It's very easy to try and navigate down too many paths at once.  If this occurs soon enough you won't be able to move forward on any of them.  Pick a path and run with it.  The biggest thing to successfully navigating any path is to BUILD. Use your resources, but stay narrowly focused to help build a solid foundation to add onto.

Remember Failure only happens when you quit! Keep moving forward and define success in your own term. 

Till Next Time...
