We have all felt the pressure, stress, and anxiety that comes with the feeling of having more tasks to finish than time left to accomplish them.  You may rise to the occasion, skip a night of sleep, or be the person that throws up your hands just giving up.  We all have different ways of dealing with the challenge of having too much to do with not enough time.  It's not about how you handle this pressure, the real question is how can we avoid this situation all together?  See we all start the day on a level playing field, nobody is given more time than anyone else. It really comes down to how we manage that time that can help us avoid these unwanted situations altogether.

This statement hits home with me and I think will with most.  We are a society driven by instant gratification and most of us don't have a plan for the week let alone a year or 3 year plan.  Still that doesn't stop us from dreaming big and packing our days as full as we can all while running around aimlessly. Has this poor time management already affected your life? Did you give up on a dream because it didn't happen fast enough?  Get frustrated because you didn't gain 20 lbs of muscle in a month? 

Often when we put to much on our plates we start under performing on everything.  The truth is we can only do so much in a given day.  So do you know what you can accomplish in a day? Can you replicate it?  These are two questions that I never asked or thought about until recently.  How can you really have control over time management if you don't know what you can accomplish in a given time?

As my journey as a web developer progresses one of the biggest struggles I have is managing time.  My issue is not putting in the time, but how I plan and track that time.  I often fall victim to the instant gratification culture and think the more time I put in the faster I'll get results.  Obviously there is some correlation to this process but there must be more.  I often feel empty and unsatisfied after putting in 10+ hours a day learning.

After working with a development team for some time now I can see why this feeling occurs more times than not.  I was lacking one key component to how I was managing my time, a baseline.  It's actually pretty straight forward, how can you make changes if you don't know what you are changing.  My lack of understanding of how long it takes me to do anything throughout my day was causing me bigger problems than I could imagine.  Blocking out time to do something does not count as time management.  If we want to see improvement we need to be able measure our times against a baseline.

Understanding your capabilities at a micro level will help eliminate situations where you don't feel like time is on your side.  In development there is a lot of methodologies that are in place to help teams plan better and be as effective as possible.  The overall picture with most of these are to create quick sprints where you can adjust and make progress quickly. It's all about making accurate time estimates to be able to deliver products and keep clients happy.  When learning something new we often focus on the tasks as a whole and creating a baseline for time isn't usually on our radar.  This is where we go wrong.

Creating a baseline when you are first learning something new might not be the biggest concern but it may be the most beneficial in the long run.  Creating a baseline helps you measure time in something other than seconds.  If you use this baseline as a starting point you can better estimate what can be accomplished in a given time frame.  Not only will your estimating become better helping you plan out your day, but progress becomes more visible.  Start taking back the time in your day.

Time Management is still a work in progress for me but with a few simple tips I have been able to improve the flow of my day and as a bonus better understand the progress of my development journey.

### My three tips to a better day:

1. **Treat Time Like A Budget**  Allocate a specific amount of time to each task or goal.  Like any good budget you can't stop at the planning phase.  Measure how you did against your planned time and use it moving forward to help adjust your plan next time. Doing this will create more accurate time management.

2. **Bookend Your Day**  Create a wakeup and bedtime schedule.  This may seem childish but by limiting your availability and creating habits like this, your time becomes more valuable.  Without these bookend you often start to think of time as a unlimited resource pushing things off or just staying up late to accomplish what you want.  Sometimes a few less hours of sleep is necessary but more times than not the same could be accomplished in less. As well as creating a more focus drive more sleep will have your brain working more efficiently.

3. **Set Priorities**  We often seem to forget that time is a limited resource. Even if you can put something off till a later date you need to ask if its worth it. Start putting a value on your time knowing that you can never get this moment back.  The next time you say I don't have enough time, review your last 24 hours minute by minute. If your honest with yourself you will find lots of opportunity to free up some of that time you don't have.  TV, social media, games, web surfing and many other non essential activities fill most of our days.  Your day doesn't have to be all work no play but if you are struggling with time management looking here might be an easy way to free up time.

If nothing else I hope that this article can help open your mind up and get you thinking of how you are spending your time.
